By default, GnuTLS will be used for stream encryption if it is found. If not,
the system will be checked for OpenSSL. If you don't want to use GnuTLS even
though you have it installed, use the --without-gnutls switch to configure.

Also by default, unit tests and example programs will be built. To save some time,
specify --without-examples and --without-tests to disable building the examples and
tests, respectively.
