Building on Symbian/Nokia S60 using S60 SDK 3rd Edition
-------------------------------------------------------

gloox compiles (at least) on:
- Linux cross-compile environment (see http://martin.st/symbian)
- Carbide.c++ 2.0

No other compilers are officially supported at this point. Please let me know about
your experiences with other compilers.

Project files (bld.inf, gloox.mmp) are included. They can be imported into Carbide.c++.

- Edit config.h.symbian to suit your needs. The defaults should be fine.
- build


NOTE WELL
---------
The code has not been tested on Symbian/S60 by the author. It has only been compiled.
Feedback is welcome.

The OpenSSL server code (class OpenSSLServer from tlsopensslserver.h/cpp) does not
compile at this point.
